# -- Exercise 2.4 If you have a spectrum object, spectrum, and print the first few
# -- values of spectrum.fs, youâ€™ll see that they start at zero. So spectrum.hs[0]
# -- is the magnitude of the component with frequency 0. But what does that
# -- mean?
# -- Try this experiment:
# -- 1. Make a triangle signal with frequency 440 and make a Wave with duration
# -- 0.01 seconds. Plot the waveform.
# -- 2. Make a Spectrum object and print spectrum.hs[0]. What is the amplitude
# -- and phase of this component?
# -- 3. Set spectrum.hs[0] = 100. What effect does this operation have on
# -- the waveform? Hint: Spectrum provides a method called make_wave
# -- that computes the Wave that corresponds to the Spectrum.
